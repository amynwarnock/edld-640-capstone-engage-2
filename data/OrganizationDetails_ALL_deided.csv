298500,Honor Society of Friars,Friars,"History of Friars\r\n\r\nIn 1910, a few seniors who were prominent on campus formally founded the Society of Friars. The organization has existed since that time, with varying periods of strength or inactivity, and shrouded in some mystery and secrecy, as “an upper-class society in good fellowship.”\r\n\r\nEach spring, a few junior students are tapped to fill out the ranks of campus Friars for fall. Occasionally a faculty member is tapped – one who is respected and liked as a teacher and who has also taken a special interest in students and student affairs. No requirements for membership have ever been published, but it has been observed, “that neither a high scholarship record nor high student office alone seem(s) to qualify, but recognition of service and leadership, past and potential.”\r\n\r\nThe names of members are inscribed each year on heavy metal scrolls or shields, which, according to Friars’ custom, are present whenever Friars gather. Through the years, the society has observed its traditional ceremonies during Homecoming and during Junior (or Spring Parents’) Weekend. During these ceremonies, black-hooded, black-robed figures carrying the engraved shields are observed marching and tapping new members and holding their banquets.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1942, when war had scattered the membership across the length and breadth of the earth’s continents, a Friar began the tradition of a periodic Friar newsletter sent to all known Friars overseas and at home. In this newsletter Friars provide news of each other. A section headed “Campus News” brings Friars news of the university, and a column “From the Actives” describes the activities of campus Friars.\r\n\r\nIn the years since World War II, Friars on campus have been involved in campus politics, in getting out the vote in general elections where matters concerning higher education are presented to voters, and in raising funds for projects such as the Erb Memorial Union. Friars who graduate from the University of Oregon have gone on to distinguish themselves in government, public service, and the professions.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960s student interest in campus organizations dwindled in a period of time when the Vietnam War was occupying the energies of many campuses. The Friars Society fell into decline, and for a period of time in the late ‘60s and ‘70s no new campus Friars were tapped.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, the Friars Society revitalized. The black robes and brass shields were seen once again as active Friars again marched on campus, tapping new members, volunteering for activities important to the quality of the University of Oregon, and linking campus Friars with Friars who have graduated.\r\n\r\nNow Friars is a diverse society of leaders from all over campus, including ASUO president and other ASUO officials, officers in the ethnic student unions, Greek leaders, and others whose love of the University of Oregon is apparent in the work they do.  It has come a long way from its beginnings, changing with the times.  As we move into the 100th year of Friars Society, we continue to grow and change!\r\n","History of FriarsIn 1910, a few seniors who were prominent on campus formally founded the Society of Friars.

334564,Minorities and Philosophy University of Oregon Chapter,MAP,"<p>MAP is a collection of students in philosophy departments that aims to examine and address issues of minority participation in academic philosophy. Though primarily led by graduate students, MAP also relies on faculty support and encourages undergraduate participation. Currently, MAP has 134 chapters throughout the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through MAP's network, students can exchange ideas on topics related to minorities and philosophy, meet and support peers, and learn from other philosophy departments. MAP chapters can choose to provide their respective departments with regular feedback on the department climate.&nbsp;<br /><br />Though the format of MAP varies from school to school, each chapter aims broadly at addressing (a) minority issues in the profession, (b) theoretical issues regarding philosophy of&nbsp;gender, race, sexual orientation, class, disability,&nbsp;native language,&nbsp;etc, and (c) philosophy&nbsp;done from minority perspectives. Meeting formats include: external or internal speakers, reading groups, film screenings, mentorship events for undergraduates or graduates, panel discussions, practical workshops (e.g., on communication techniques,&nbsp;navigating stereotype threat or implicit bias).<br /><br />In the short term, MAP provides a forum for students to discuss these topics and connect with interested peers. In the long term, we hope that MAP will contribute to improved department cultures and facilitate increased participation of underrepresented groups in academic philosophy.</p>\r\n<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The UO MAP chapter was created in 2019-2020 with the following events and goals in mind: a weekly reading group on &ldquo;Philosophy in the Margins&rdquo; that collaborates with the Undergraduate Philosophy Club that is hosted and facilitated by graduate student MAP members (with undergraduates selecting readings with graduate approval once the reading group is up and running); a MAP library for students to check out and read materials (located in SCH 211); hangout events such as &ldquo;Filmosophy nights&rdquo;; workshops on graduate school applications; mentoring for students throughout their career at UO; weekly office hours to discuss issues with diversity in philosophy/the department; &ldquo;Philosophy Chats&rdquo; with professors sharing their work and their own stories from within and without the Philosophy department (and including professors in Native American Studies, Latinx Studies, Women and Gender Studies, etc.); constructing a handbook for incoming students with a diversity focus. Our hope for this upcoming term is to focus on a specific philosopher in our reading groups and meeting in public parks so there is a more communal aspect.</span></p>",MAP is an international organization that addresses issues of structural injustices in academic philosophy as well as aims to remove barriers to participation in academic philosophy for marginalized groups.

298416,Multicultural Center,MCC,"The Multicultural Center, based on the EMU student union hall, ideally aspired to be a center “where all students would be welcomed to meet, plan, and help with educating the community about diversity.” The student-funded MCC was approved in the mid-1990s and became the catalyst for a series of changes. The MCC is a hub of activism, connecting students of all races and backgrounds, especially by listserve and computer bulletin boards to encourage collaboration around diversity programming and education. The MCC has sponsored annual conferences on diversity, featuring renown keynote speakers including historians Howard Zinn (author of People’s History of the United States), professors Angela Davids, poet/playwright Amiri Baraka, actor edward James Olmos, activist Bobby Seale, Father Roy Bourgeois, global performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Yolando King (daughter of MLK), the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Adelina Anthony, Elaine Brown, Athen’s Boys Choir, among Many others. The MCC accommodates any meetings of student unions, educational and cultural workshops, guest speakers and artists, art displays, open mic spoken word events, hip hop concerts, etc. The MCC also houses a resource library of books and videos, and a small computer lab for students to work on academic and union projects. The MCC provides potential coalition space for disparate groups in one physical location, encouraging dialogue and cooperation towards achieving common goals, as well as union general meeting space.\r\n\r\n\r\nA significant result of the struggle in 1999 against a campus hate crime against women of color, and part of the overall effort to achieve more equity and a climate of fairness and safety on campus, was the initial project of 10 student interns who researched and formulated a new diversity initiative plan. The diversity interns defined the concept of diversity in a broad inclusive way, combining gender and ethnic constituents’ concerns and derhands:\r\n\r\n“It (diversity) means recognizing our individual differences. These can be along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio0economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs, or other ideologies. It is the exploration of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment moving beyond simple tolerance to embracing and celebrating the rich dimensions of diversity contained in each individual.” (from original U.O. diversity internship web site)\r\n\r\nSince then, the student staff, student volunteer base and faculty/staff allies of the MCC have taken up numerous campaigns to improve the climate of the campus, including the effort to rid the campus of its past contractual affiliations with hate radio; to stop institutional efforts to cut back staff at the Office of Multicultural Academic Success; and to resist culturally incompetent assaults by EMU administrators on the MCC and its staff; as well as to coalition with faculty and the ASUO to departmentalize Ethnic Studeies and Women’s Studies etc.\r\n\r\n“In the next millennium, the University of Oregon will continue to change. Students of color have become agents of change, altering and adding value to educational policies, changing the direction of curriculum; and calling attention to an unfriendly campus climate that has too often tolerated racism, (sexism, homophobia, and other oppressive behaviors.) Working together in coalitions as well as in separate groups, students of color (and other underrepresented groups) have been instrumental in pressing for progress. By questioning and challenging the university’s academic and social life, students have advocated for improvements that build a safe and culturally pluralistic learning environment.”\r\n\r\n– excerpt from the book Making a Difference? University Students of Color Speak Out, (chapter 6) by Donna Wong and Julia Lesage (Littlefield Publishers)\r\n\r\n———————————————————–\r\n\r\nHistorical Summary\r\n\r\nThe Multicultural Center was founded, sustained, and developed by student activists of diverse backgrounds and cultures, resulting from historically recent efforts to create a more inclusive and diverse campus community since 1995. The MCC was born and developed out of the campaign for a multicultural curriculum requirement that would encourage scholarship, a more tolerant respectful campus community, and a more accurate, truthful and inclusive pedagogy to prepare students for an increasingly diverse world. It was formed to fill the needs of students of color and other marginalized students that were not sufficiently addressed by the university’s other programs and services.","The Multicultural Center, based on the EMU student union hall, ideally aspired to be a center “where all students would be welcomed to meet, plan, and help with educating the community about diversity.” The student-funded MCC was approved in the mid-19...",Hidden,Inactive,,,,,,Student Life

Five coeds envisioned a sorority which would directly affect positive change, chart a course of action for the 1920s and beyond, raise consciousness of their people, encourage the highest standards of scholastic achievement, and foster a greater sense of unity among its members.  These women believed that sorority elitism and socializing overshadowed the real mission for progressive organizations and failed to address fully the societal mores, ills, prejudices, and poverty affecting humanity in general and the black community in particular.\r\n\r\nSince its inception, Zeta has continued its steady climb into the national spotlight with programs designed to demonstrate concern for the human condition both nationally and internationally.  The organization has been innovative in that it has chronicled a number of firsts.  It was the first National Pan-Hellenic Council organization to centralize its operations in a national headquarters, first to charter a chapter in Africa, first to form auxiliary groups, and first to be constitutionally bound to a fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.   The sorority takes pride in its continued participation in transforming communities through volunteer services from members and its auxiliaries.  Zeta Phi Beta has chartered hundreds of chapters worldwide and has a membership of 100,000+.\r\n\r\nZeta‘s national and local programs include the endowment of its National Educational Foundation community outreach services and support of multiple affiliate organizations.  Zeta chapters and auxiliaries have given untotaled hours of voluntary service to educate the public, assist youth, provide scholarships, support organized charities, and promote legislation for social and civic change.\r\n\r\nAs the sorority moves toward its centennial, it retains its original zest for excellence.  It espouses the highest academic ideals and that has resulted in its members serving in groundbreaking roles in all fields of endeavor.

Politics is, whether you like it or not, a team sport. To unite together, moderates must have a set of values that they all abide by, so here's a set of values this club supports:</p>\r\n<p>- Support for capitalism, innovation, and trade, with regulations when necessary</p>\r\n<p>- Funding for social programs to help those in unfortunate situations</p>\r\n<p>- Belief in preserving democratic institutions, and reforming them when necessary</p>\r\n<p>- A serious but open-minded approach to fighting climate change and pollution</p>\r\n<p>- Acceptance of the cultural diversity of the US and its immigrants</p>\r\n<p>- Strong national security coupled with global leadership</p>\r\n<p>- Creating a society in which everyone has an opportunity to succeed</p>\r\n<p>Even with these shared values, moderates can still have strong disagreements on policy positions. Just how much funding should there be on social programs? How much regulation is necessary in the economy? What is the best way to tackle climate change?
